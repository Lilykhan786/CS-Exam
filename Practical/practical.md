### List of Programs for Term 1 Practical File CS Class 12

> I will start the programs from the functions and then data file handling.You can use the suggested list of programs as well in your Term 1 Practical File CS Class 12.

The first three programs of Term 1 Practical File CS Class 12 are taken from the topic and chapter **working with functions.**

1. [ ] Write a python program using a function to print factorial number series from n to m numbers.
2. [ ] Write a python program to accept username “Admin” as default argument and password 123 entered by user to allow login into the system.
3. [ ] Write a python program to demonstrate the concept of variable length argument to calculate product and power of the first 10 numbers.

The next section of Term 1 Practical File CS Class 12 I will add some programs based on data file handling.

1. [ ] Create a text file “intro.txt” in python and ask the user to write a single line text by user input.
2. [ ] Write a program to count a total number of lines and count the total number of lines starting with ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’ from the file dfh.txt.

In the next section of Term 1 Practical File CS Class 12 you will get some programs based on data file handling for binary files.

1. [ ] Write a program to store customer data into a binary file cust.dat using a dictionary and print them on screen after reading them. The customer data contains ID as key, and name, city as values.

2. [ ] Write a program to create a binary file sales.dat and write a menu driven program to do the following:
   - Insert record 
   - Search Record
   - Update Record
   - Display record
   - Exit

3. [ ] Write a function to write data into binary file marks.dat and display the records of students who scored more than 95 marks.

4. [ ] Write a function to count records from the binary file marks.dat.

The next section of Term 1 Practical File CS Class 12 consists of programs based on CSV Files. Let’s see them!

1. [ ] Read a CSV file top5.csv and print the contents in a proper format. The data for top5.csv file are as following:

|S.No|Batsman     |Team   |Runs |Highest|
|--- |---         |---    |---  |---    |
|1   |K L Rahul   | KXI	  |670  |132*   |
|2	 |S Dhawan    |	DC	  |618  |106*   |
|3	 |David Warner|	SRH	  |548  |85*    |
|4	 |Shreyas Iyer|	DC	  |519  |88*    |
|5	 |Ishan Kishan|	MI  	|516  |99     |

2. [ ] Read a CSV file students.csv and print them with tab delimiter. Ignore first row header to print in tabular form. 
3. [ ] Write records of students into result.csv. The fields are as following:

|Field 1	   |Data Type |
|---         |---       |
|StudentID	 |Integer   |
|StudentName |String    |
|Score 	     |Integer   |  

4. [ ] Count the number of records and column names present in the CSV file.

Concepts used:

1. Skip first row using next() method
2. line_num properties used to count the no. of rows
