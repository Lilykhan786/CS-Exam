# Python
Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. <br />
It was created by **Guido van Rossum** during 1985- 1990, and was released in 1991.

### It is used for:
1. AI and machine learning 
2. Data analytics and visualisation
3. Programming applications 
4. Web development 
5. Game development 
6. SEO


### Note - 
1. Unlike other programming languages Python doesn't support multi-line comment.  <br />
But you can use `"""` for multi-line comments.
> *(Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it)*
